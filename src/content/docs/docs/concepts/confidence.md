---

This is a plain-language explainer for how VectorStep decides how much to trust an
agent's output, and what every knob along the way actually does. If you want
the precise technical reference (field names, config schemas, DB columns), see
the [Reference](/docs/reference/api/) section — this page is for understanding
the *why* and the *effect*, not the exact syntax.

## The problem this solves

An agent finishes a task and says "I'm 95% confident." Should you believe it?

LLMs are not naturally good at this. A model can be completely wrong and still
say "95% confident" in a calm, well-structured sentence — confidence, as an
agent reports it, is a *style* of writing as much as it is a real measurement.
If VectorStep just trusted that number at face value, an overconfident wrong answer
would sail straight through any gate you set.

So instead of trusting one number, VectorStep builds up a **trust vector** — several
independent signals, combined conservatively — and only lets a step act
automatically when the *weakest* one still clears the bar. Not an average. The
floor.

There are four signals:

| Signal | Question it answers | Nickname |
|---|---|---|
| **S** | What did the agent say about itself? | Self-report |
| **V** | What does a second opinion say? | Verifier |
| **G** | Is the agent's story actually backed by evidence it collected? | Grounding |
| **D** | Does an external, computer-checkable fact confirm or deny it? | Deterministic check |

Plus **calibration**, which sits on top of all of this and asks a different
question entirely: *does this agent's confidence number actually mean what it
claims to mean, based on its real track record?*

Below, each signal in turn — what it is, how it's produced, and every knob that
changes its behaviour.

## S — the self-report

This is just the `confidence` field the primary agent returns in its own JSON
output, e.g. `0.95`. It costs nothing extra — every step already produces this.
It's the starting point, and by itself it's the least trustworthy number in the
whole system, because it's the agent grading its own work with no outside check
at all.

Nothing to configure here — it's just whatever the agent says.

## V — the verifier (a second opinion)

A verifier is a *second* agent call whose whole job is to sanity-check the
first one. It only fires if you configure a `verifier:` block on a step (see
[Verifiers](/docs/pipelines/verifiers/) for the full configuration reference).

### Two ways to ask for a second opinion

**`mode: critic`** (the default) — the second agent sees the primary's original
instructions *and* its finished answer, and is asked "does this reasoning hold
up?" It's like a colleague reviewing your written report: they can catch a
logical gap, a claim that contradicts itself, or check the primary's specific
factual claims — "was a ticket really created," "was a document really read" —
against the actual tool-call evidence, not just judge whether the prose sounds
plausible.

**`mode: independent`** — the second agent gets *only* the original task, with
zero sight of what the primary said. It goes and does the whole task itself,
blind, from scratch. It's like handing the same assignment to two different
people separately and seeing if they land in the same place.

**Why the difference matters:** a critic's *agreement* with the primary tells
you very little, because if the primary made a mistake, the same mistake is
often sitting right there in the material the critic is reading — the critic's
errors are *correlated* with the primary's. An independent agent's agreement is
worth much more, because it made its own mistakes (or didn't) completely
separately — its errors are *uncorrelated*. Use `independent` for any step
that's about to trigger a real side effect; `critic` is fine (and cheaper) for
steps that just inform the next step.

### How the two scores get combined

Two strategies, set via `combination_strategy`:

- **`minimum`** (the default) — the final score is simply whichever of the two
  is lower. Blunt, but simple: neither agent gets to inflate the other's score.
- **`veto`** — the primary's score is left alone *unless* the verifier scores
  below a set floor (`veto_floor`, default 0.60). Below that floor, the
  verifier's low score overrides. Above it, the verifier's opinion is noted but
  doesn't change anything. Think of it as "I'll take your word for it, unless a
  second opinion actively says this is bad."

**The one rule that never breaks, regardless of strategy: a verifier can only
ever lower the primary's score, or leave it unchanged — never raise it.** This
is deliberate and enforced by code, with a permanent regression test locking it
in. If a correlated second opinion were allowed to *boost* your confidence,
you'd get exactly the "two guesses agree, so it must be right" false comfort
that makes AI consensus untrustworthy in high-stakes settings.

### The trace-visibility knob

`max_trace_chars` (default 1500, `critic` mode only) controls how much of the
primary's actual tool-call transcript the critic gets to see. If a claim's
supporting evidence lives past this cutoff, the critic genuinely cannot see
it — it isn't being harsh, it's blind past that point. Raise this for steps
whose tools return long content (a full document read, a large query result).

## G — grounding (fact-checking the story against the evidence)

Where the verifier asks "does the *reasoning* hold up," grounding asks a
narrower, harder question: **for every specific claim the agent made, is there
an actual tool call or tool result in its own trace that backs it up?** It's
not judging whether the conclusion is *right* — only whether it's *anchored to
real evidence* rather than plausible-sounding assertion.

A separate "judge" agent gets the original task, the primary's response, and a
formatted transcript of the primary's tool calls, and returns a score — the
fraction of load-bearing claims (a root cause, a specific number, a ticket ID)
that a tool result actually supports.

### Shadow vs enforced

By default, grounding is **shadow mode**: it computes and records the score,
but never changes anything. This lets you watch, for weeks if you want, how
often an agent's confidence and its actual grounding diverge, with zero risk to
production behaviour.

Set `grounding.enforce: true` and it starts to matter: the grounding score
becomes a **ceiling**. `combined_trust = min(combined_trust, G)` — if the
evidence is weak, no amount of confident-sounding prose from anywhere else in
the chain can push the trust above that ceiling.

### The truncation gotcha (a real, common source of false alarms)

Both the trace-formatting step in VectorStep (`grounding.max_trace_chars`, default
1500) and the Gateway that actually runs the tool calls
(`limits.trace_tool_result_max_chars`, default 3000, overridable per-step via
`executor_config.trace_max_chars`) cap how much of a tool result gets kept for
the record. If a claim's supporting evidence sits past either cutoff, grounding
will flag it as "unsupported" — and that looks *exactly* like a hallucination,
even though the agent genuinely did the work and the evidence genuinely exists,
just not within reach of what got captured. If grounding keeps flagging things
you're confident are real, raise both cutoffs together — raising only one just
moves the same wall to a different spot in the pipe.

Reassuringly: this cutoff only affects what gets *recorded for review*. The
agent itself always sees the full, untruncated tool output when it's actually
doing the work — truncation never makes the agent itself less capable, only
makes grounding (and a human reviewer) less able to check its work after the
fact.

See [Grounding keeps flagging real evidence as
unsupported](/docs/troubleshooting/fixing-grounding-accuracy/) for a
step-by-step fix, including a third truncation point — the grounding
judge's own `max_tokens` — that produces a different symptom (a parse
failure, not a low score) from the two cutoffs above.

### The other blind spot this fixes: knowing what was actually asked

Grounding (and critic-mode verifiers) are shown the primary's *original
instructions*, not just its answer. Without this, a claim that simply restates
something the agent was *given* — the alert's severity, which service it's
about — would look exactly like an unverified claim, because there'd be no tool
call backing it up (it never needed one; it was handed the fact as input). The
judge is told explicitly: facts already present in the original task need no
evidence, only claims that go beyond the given input do.

## D — deterministic checks (hard, computer-verified facts)

Everything above is still an LLM making a judgement call. Deterministic checks
are the one signal that isn't: a `shell` command, a `webhook` call, or a
`human` approval, evaluated directly by the runner — no model involved in the
pass/fail decision at all.

Examples: "is this metric still actually breaching, right now, via a real
Prometheus query" or "does this ticket ID actually resolve." These aren't
opinions — they're facts you can check.

**A failed deterministic check is dispositive.** If any declared check fails,
`combined_trust` is forced straight to **zero**, no matter how confident
everything else in the chain was. This is the strongest, most trustworthy
signal in the whole system, and it's treated that way: no averaging, no partial
credit, nothing else gets a vote once a hard check fails.

**Fail-closed, not fail-soft.** If a check errors, times out, or can't be
evaluated for any reason, that counts as **failed** — the opposite of
grounding's philosophy, where a failed grounding call just means "no extra
signal, no penalty." The reasoning: D is meant to be the one thing you can
absolutely rely on, so an unanswerable check must not silently vanish and let
everything proceed as if nothing was checked.

## Putting it together — the actual formula

For a step with everything turned on, in the exact order the runner applies it:

```
S              — the primary's self-report
  ↓ (verifier combine — minimum or veto)
S_after_V      — S adjusted by the verifier; can only be ≤ S
  ↓ (calibration, IF enforce: true and the bucket is validated)
calibrated     — S_after_V REPLACED by this exact agent/model's real track record
                 (can go up OR down — this is the one exception to "never raises")
  ↓ (grounding, IF enforce: true — a ceiling, min())
capped         — pulled down further if the evidence doesn't back up the claims
  ↓ (deterministic checks — force to zero on any failure)
combined_trust — the final number
  ↓
compare to the step's confidence_threshold
  ↓
proceed  or  escalate / abort / proceed-anyway (per on_low_confidence)
```

**Weakest link, not average.** At every stage, a bad signal can only pull the
number down (calibration is the sole exception, and even then it's replacing
the seed with a *measured* fact, not "boosting" it for optimism's sake). A
control decision — "should this step be allowed to actually do something" —
needs the floor, because a comfortable-looking average can hide the one thing
that's actually wrong.

**A step with none of these configured is completely unaffected.** No verifier,
no grounding, no deterministic checks, no calibration — the step behaves
exactly as it always has: raw self-report versus threshold, nothing more. Every
mechanism above is strictly additive and opt-in.

## Calibration — does the number mean what it claims?

Everything above assumes S, V, and G are each individually meaningful.
Calibration is the mechanism that actually checks that assumption, per agent,
per model, empirically — using this exact system's own history rather than
trusting the number on its own terms. This section is the plain-language
version; [Calibration](/docs/pipelines/calibration/) is the technical
reference for bucketing, labelling, binning, and the `calibration:` block's
knobs.

### The core idea

Suppose a particular agent, running on a particular model, has reported
"90–100% confidence" on 30 past occasions. If a human later marked those runs,
and it turns out only 20 of the 30 were actually correct — that's **67% actual
accuracy**, not the ~95% the confidence number implied. That agent, at that
confidence level, is overconfident. Calibration measures this directly and, if
you opt in, uses the measured 67% instead of trusting the self-report.

### How it's measured

For every distinct `(step, agent, model, provider, prompt_hash, agent_version)`
combination, every past marked run is sorted into a **bin** based on what
confidence it reported — by default, ten bins, each covering a 10-point range
(0–10%, 10–20%, …, 90–100%). Within each bin, calibration computes the **mean
label** — the average of what actually happened, not what was predicted:

- A human marked it `correct` → counts as 1.0
- A human marked it `partial` → counts as 0.5
- A human marked it `incorrect` → counts as 0.0
- No human mark, but a deterministic check failed → counts as 0.0 (a failed
  hard check is a strong enough automated signal to count as "wrong," for free,
  at scale)
- No step-level mark or check failure, but the whole *run* was marked → falls
  back to that run's outcome
- None of the above → excluded entirely (not counted as a zero, not counted at
  all)

That mean is the bin's real, measured accuracy — completely independent of what
the confidence score itself said, which is the whole point.

Fixed-width bins, not a fitted curve — deliberately. It's directly readable
("this bucket, this many samples, this accuracy") the way a smooth regression
line isn't, and it needed no new numerical-computing dependency for a
single-operator service.

### Why it needs enough data before you trust it

A bin with 2 samples telling you "0% accurate" is noise, not a fact. Each bin
needs `n_min` (default 20) marked outcomes before it's considered
**validated**. Below that, it's advisory-only regardless of what the raw number
looks like.

### Editing a prompt or an agent resets the measurement — deliberately

The bucket key above includes two more components than you might expect:
`prompt_hash` (a content hash of the step's `prompt_template`) and
`agent_version` (a content hash the Gateway computes over an agent's entire
config, including `soul.md`). Here's why, and what you'll actually see when it
happens.

**The bug this closes.** Before these existed, editing a step's prompt — or
editing an agent's `soul.md` on the Gateway, which VectorStep had no visibility into
at all — silently kept counting outcomes from the OLD configuration as
evidence for the NEW one. For a step with `calibration: {enforce: true}`, that
meant the gate was making a real control decision using a measured accuracy
figure that described a prompt or agent that no longer existed. Nothing told
you this was happening.

**What you'll see instead.** Edit a prompt template, or edit an agent's
`agent.yaml`/`soul.md` on the Gateway, and the next run under that changed
configuration starts a *new* bucket at n=0 — even though the
step/agent/model/provider combination is identical to before. If that step had
`calibration: {enforce: true}` and was passing (a validated bucket), it falls
back to `on_uncalibrated` behaviour (escalating, by default proceeding) until
the new bucket earns its own `n_min` marked results. The run-detail Trust panel
names this explicitly rather than leaving you to guess why a step "suddenly"
started behaving differently:

> Calibration was reset when this step's prompt changed on 3 Jul. The previous
> version had 47 marked results; this one has 4 of the 20 needed.

**This is deliberate, and reverting restores it.** A bucket that blends two
different prompts isn't a bigger sample, it's a wrong one — the reset is the
correct behaviour, not a side effect to route around. And because the registry
is content-addressed (keyed by the hash itself), reverting a prompt back to its
exact previous text automatically rejoins that version's original bucket and
every label it earned — nothing is lost by trying an edit and changing your
mind. Two versions of the same step, side by side with their own calibration
bins, are visible from the Steps Insights page's **Prompt history** disclosure
(`GET /steps/{name}/versions`) — and the equivalent for an agent's config
history is `GET /agents/{name}/versions`, reachable from the `agent <hash>`
chip on any run that used it.

### Two postures: advisory (always on) vs enforcing (opt-in)

**Advisory — no configuration needed, ever on.** The Steps Insights page shows,
for every agent/model combination, its calibration bins — validated ones
colour-coded by whether the predicted score and the actual accuracy line up,
with a plain-English flag when a validated bin diverges by 15 points or more
("runs scoring ~90% here are only 75% correct"). Nothing about this changes any
run's outcome. You look, you decide — raise the threshold, swap the model, add
grounding — the tool never acts on your behalf.

**Enforcing — opt-in, per step, `calibration: {enforce: true}`.** Once you
trust a measurement enough to let it actually change behaviour, this step's
gate stops trusting the raw self-report/verifier number outright and instead
asks: "for this specific confidence level, what does this exact agent/model's
real history say?" If the relevant bin is validated, that measured number
*replaces* the raw score before grounding and deterministic checks apply on top
of it.

If the bin **isn't** validated yet — a brand-new agent/model combination with
no track record — `on_uncalibrated` decides what happens:

- **`proceed`** (the default) — behave exactly as if calibration weren't
  configured at all. No penalty for being new and unproven.
- **`escalate`** — treat "no track record yet" as untrustworthy on purpose,
  forcing `combined_trust` to zero until the bucket earns enough history. This
  is the deliberate "a brand-new configuration should have a human check it
  until it's proven" policy — an opt-in choice for high-stakes steps, never the
  default anywhere.

### The one place calibration breaks the "only ever lowers" rule

Every other mechanism above is downward-only. Calibration is not — if an agent
has been systematically *underselling* itself (says 60%, is actually right 95%
of the time), an enforced, validated bucket will raise the number used for the
gate above the raw self-report. This is intentional: calibration isn't
correcting for a second opinion's correlated errors, it's substituting a
measured fact for a guess, and that measured fact can point either direction.

## A worked example, start to finish

A step self-reports 95% confidence. It has a `critic` verifier, enforced
grounding, one deterministic check, and enforced calibration.
`confidence_threshold: 0.75`.

1. **S = 95%.** The agent's own number.
2. **Verifier (critic, veto strategy, floor 60%)** comes back at 85%. 85% is
   above the 60% floor, so nothing changes — **S_after_V stays at 95%**.
3. **Calibration** looks up this exact agent/model's history at the 90–100%
   confidence level: 31 past marked runs, only correct 62% of the time. The
   bucket is validated (31 ≥ 20), so **62% replaces the 95%**.
4. **Grounding (enforced)** checks the tool trace against the claims made, and
   finds only 50% of them actually backed by evidence. 50% is lower than 62%,
   so it becomes the new ceiling — **capped at 50%**.
5. **Deterministic check** ("is this still breaching, checked live against
   Prometheus") passes — no further effect.
6. **Final combined_trust = 50%.** Compared against the 75% threshold: 50%
   falls short, so the step **escalates** to a human instead of proceeding
   automatically — even though the agent itself was "95% confident" the whole
   time.

Every one of those five steps, with the exact numbers for that specific run, is
visible in the run-detail page's Trust panel, under **"How was this
calculated?"**

## Quick-reference: every knob and what it does

| Knob | Where | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `confidence_threshold` | step | `0.75` | The bar `combined_trust` is compared against. Existed before any of this; nothing above replaces it. |
| `on_low_confidence` | step | `escalate` | What happens when the bar isn't cleared: `escalate` / `abort` / `proceed`. |
| `verifier.mode` | step | `critic` | `critic` (sees primary's answer, reviews reasoning) or `independent` (blind, redoes the task). |
| `verifier.combination_strategy` | step | `minimum` | `minimum` (always take the lower score) or `veto` (only override below a floor). |
| `verifier.veto_floor` | step | `0.60` | Only used with `veto` — how low V has to score to override S. |
| `verifier.max_trace_chars` | step | `1500` | How much tool-call transcript a `critic` verifier gets to see. |
| `grounding.enforce` | step | `false` | `false` = record G only, never gate. `true` = G caps `combined_trust`. |
| `grounding.max_trace_chars` | step | `1500` | How much tool-call transcript the grounding judge gets to see. |
| `executor_config.trace_max_chars` | step (gateway executor) | `3000` (Gateway's own default) | Raises the Gateway's own cap on tool-result trace length for this step — the upstream half of the truncation gotcha above. |
| `deterministic_checks` | step | none | List of `shell` / `webhook` / `human` checks; any failure forces trust to zero. |
| `calibration.enforce` | step | `false` | `false` = advisory only (still visible on Insights). `true` = validated buckets replace the raw score. |
| `calibration.on_uncalibrated` | step | `proceed` | What an enforced-but-unvalidated bucket does: `proceed` (no penalty) or `escalate` (treat as untrustworthy until proven). |
| `calibration.n_min` | service config.yaml | `20` | Marked outcomes a bin needs before it's trusted. |
| `calibration.bin_width` | service config.yaml | `0.1` | Width of each confidence bucket. |
| `prompt_hash` | derived, not configured | — | Content hash of the step's `prompt_template`. Part of every calibration bucket's key — editing the prompt starts a new bucket. |
| `agent_version` | derived, not configured (Gateway-owned) | — | Content hash of the Gateway agent's full config incl. `soul.md`. Also part of every bucket's key — editing `agent.yaml`/`soul.md` on the Gateway resets calibration in VectorStep, even though nothing in VectorStep's own YAML changed. |

`readiness.confidence.*`, `readiness.accuracy.*`, `readiness.calibration.*`),
see [Promotion readiness](/docs/concepts/readiness/).

**Safety property:** adding a `readiness:` block never resets a calibration
bucket — `prompt_hash` is computed from `prompt_template` **text only**, so
`readiness:` (which lives alongside, not inside, the prompt) can't touch it.

## Where to actually see all of this

- **Run detail page, per step:** the **Step configuration** disclosure (what
  this step is set up to do) and **"How was this calculated?"** (what actually
  happened, this run, in plain language with real numbers) both live in the
  Trust panel. **Prompt** disclosures on the primary, verifier, and grounding
  sections show exactly what each agent was actually asked, with
  `template <hash>` / `agent <hash>` chips linking to that prompt's or agent's
  own version history.
- **Steps Insights (`/ui/insights/steps`):** calibration bins for every
  agent/model/prompt-version combination, with the divergence flag — this is
  where you watch calibration before ever turning on `enforce: true`. The
  **Prompt history** disclosure per step shows every recorded prompt version
  with its date range, run count, labelled count, and a diff against the
  version before it — "did that edit actually help?" made answerable with data.
- **Agent detail → Versions tab:** every `agent_version` VectorStep has a snapshot
  for, with a diff of `soul.md` against the version before it and the list of
  steps that version actually affected.
- **Pipeline detail page, "Promotion readiness" card** (`stage: testing`
  pipelines): per-step tier chips for
  `operational`/`confidence`/`accuracy`/`calibration`, a "How is this judged?"
  disclosure with a plain-language narrative and label provenance. See
  [Promotion readiness](/docs/concepts/readiness/).
- **Marking queue (`/ui/marking-queue`):** every step across every pipeline
  with no *human* accuracy feedback yet — the exact gap
  `accuracy.min_human_marked` checks for — grouped by pipeline then step,
  linked out to the run to mark it.
